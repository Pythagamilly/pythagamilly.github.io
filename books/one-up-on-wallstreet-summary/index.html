<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<h4 id="balance-sheets">Balance Sheets</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cash flow is a good indicator of company&rsquo;s prosperity. An increasing cash flow from year to year is an indicator of an improving company.</li>
<li>Long-term debt reduction is another sign of prosperity. Compare long-term debt over the years and if it is reducing, that&rsquo;s a good sign.</li>
<li>Cash exceeding debt it is very favourable. A company cannot go bankrupt if it has more cash than debt.</li>
<li>One quick way of determining the financial strength of a company is to take their assets (inventories, receivables, plant, equipment) and see how it is financed. If there&rsquo;s enough cash to finance short term debt you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the short term.</li>
<li>The bottom line, profit after taxes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-product">The Product</h4>
<ul>
<li>A small company with few products that has one which does well means more than a large company with many products that has one do well. Small companies have big moves, big companies have small moves (in stock price).</li>
<li>Inventory build up is usually a bad sign, it can mean inventory is not being sold.</li>
<li>LIFO - last in first out. Gold is bought at $40 an oz 30 years ago, and some is bought at $400 recently. Last in first out means that if we sell an oz of Gold today at $450 we earn $50.</li>
<li>FIFO - First in first out. As above if we sold Gold for $450 we would earn $410 because we count the Gold we bought 30 years ago.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="objective-price-measures">Objective Price Measures</h4>
<ul>
<li>A p/e ratio of a company that is fairly priced will equal its growth rate.</li>
<li>A company with a p/e ration smaller than it&rsquo;s growth rate is a bargain.</li>
<li>Price to earnings can be calculated, taking dividends into account is:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Long-term Growth Rate + divident yield / Price to Earnings 
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Less than 1 is poor, 1.5 is okay and 2 or more is good.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="book-value">Book Value</h4>
<ul>
<li>Book value may pay little resemblance to the actual worth of a company. Book value can be high on a bankrupt company.</li>
<li>The book value may be priced at 400 million, but may only get 200 million in a bankruptcy sale, it is not a good measure of anything.</li>
<li>You have to have a good understanding of a company&rsquo;s assets to properly appreciate book value. e.g. a bunch of tunnels, train tracks and rail cars may have a big book value but be worthless in reality.</li>
<li>The opposite can be true of book value. Mining companies, for example, carry their land / natural resources as a book value at a fraction of their potential.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cash-flow">Cash Flow</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cash flow is the money a company earns as a result of their business.</li>
<li>All companies earn cash, some have to spend more for each dollar earned.</li>
<li>A $20 stock with a $2 cash flow has a 10-1 ratio which is &lsquo;standard&rsquo;. This is a 10% return on each stock you own.</li>
<li>Free cash flow is the important measure. It&rsquo;s cash that is earned and does not have to be spent.</li>
<li>With $10 in cash per share the price is unlikely to drop lower than $10 per share.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="good-signs">Good Signs</h4>
<ul>
<li>If insiders are buying, or the company itself is buying stocks, it is a good sign.</li>
<li>The company has been able to replicate its success in one location or products into others.</li>
<li>Small companies that are already profitable and have proven their concept can be replicated.</li>
<li>A good company that is boring, uninteresting and hasn&rsquo;t been discovered by big investors yet.</li>
<li>The fundamentals are up and the price is down.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bad-signs">Bad Signs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the &lsquo;hot&rsquo; or &lsquo;meme&rsquo; stocks, especially if they&rsquo;re in a &lsquo;hot&rsquo; industry.</li>
<li>The fundamentals are down and the price is up.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="when-to-sell">When to Sell</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you know why you bought a stock you will have an idea if you need to sell that stock if those conditions no longer exist.</li>
<li>Inventories are building up and the company cannot get rid of them. They will have to drop prices.</li>
<li>The company stops building new stores / expanding and there are other worrying signs about their business in general, like they don&rsquo;t stock acid wash denim.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="general-points">General Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>If a stock you&rsquo;ve bought goes down, and you&rsquo;re waiting for it to go back to the price you bought it at to sell, you may  be waiting a long time. Take the loss. This is assuming the fundamentals do not improve.</li>
<li>Stock prices can move in the opposite direction to fundamentals, but over the long term price follows fundamentals.</li>
<li>People who are impatient with slow growers and want to get-rich-quick often opt for getting poor quicker.</li>
<li>Just because a stock goes up doesn&rsquo;t mean you were right to buy it.</li>
<li>It is better to buy a good company that is already doing well (i.e. Google) than try to pick the next good company.</li>
<li>A lousy cheap stock is just as bad as a lousy expensive one.</li>
</ul>
